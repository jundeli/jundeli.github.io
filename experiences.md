          <strong>Pennsylvania State University (01/2019 - Present)
</strong><br />
         Machine Learning for Autonomous Systems <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Perception for autonomous vehicles:</b> proposed a novel hybrid algorithm for filtering out false positives in object detections with state-of-the-art accuracy for both generic and pedestrian detections. <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Driving behavior estimation for autonomous vehicles:</b> designed a power-efficient FPGA embedded systems of machine learning model GMM-HMM for predicting driving behaviors of surrounding vehicles. <br />
         Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Quantum generative neural networks:</b> working on quantum generative networks for creating a large amount of drug candidates that are potentially effective for ongoing global pandemic by exploiting quantum computing advantage. <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Hybrid quantum-classical optimization:</b> designed an efficient hybrid algorithm for solving large-scale maximum cut-like NP-hard problems with near-optimal solutions and exponential speedup. <br />
